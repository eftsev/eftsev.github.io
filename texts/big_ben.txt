*Big Ben* (bold)\n\nBig Ben is the nickname for the Great Bell housed within the Elizabeth Tower at the north end of the Palace of Westminster in London. Though commonly used to refer to the entire structure, “Big Ben” originally referred only to the bell itself. The tower was completed in 1859 and renamed the Elizabeth Tower in 2012 to mark Queen Elizabeth II’s Diamond Jubilee.\nStanding 96 meters tall, the tower was designed in the neo-Gothic style by Augustus Pugin, working with architect Charles Barry. Constructed from brick and clad in limestone, the tower features a cast iron spire and four large clock dials, each measuring seven meters in diameter. The clock’s minute hands are over four meters long, while the hour hands are shorter and made of gunmetal.
\nThe Great Bell weighs approximately 13.5 tons and produces its iconic chime on the hour. It cracked shortly after being installed but was repaired by rotating it and fitting a lighter hammer, resulting in the distinctive tone still heard today. The tower also contains four smaller quarter bells, which chime every fifteen minutes.\nThe clock mechanism, designed by Edward John Dent, is known for its precision. Traditional penny coins are still used to regulate the pendulum. Despite wartime bombings and major renovations, the clock has remained a lasting symbol of British resilience and tradition.\nToday, Big Ben continues to function as a working clock and a timekeeping symbol of Parliament. The chimes are used for ceremonial occasions, national events, and are broadcast live by the BBC, maintaining its role as a cultural and political icon.
